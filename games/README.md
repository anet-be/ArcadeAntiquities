# Project Arcade - Web Games

This repository contains a basic frontend application featuring two classic web games: **Pac-Man** and **Space Invaders**. The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and bundled with Webpack for efficient development and deployment.

## Games Included

- **Pac-Man**: The iconic maze game where you navigate Pac-Man through a maze, avoiding ghosts and eating pellets.
- **Space Invaders**: The classic arcade space shooter game where you must destroy waves of alien invaders.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

You need to have **Node.js** and **npm** (Node Package Manager) installed on your machine. If you donâ€™t have them yet, you can download and install them from [here](https://nodejs.org/).

### Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository from GitLab:

```bash
git clone https://gitlab.com/kdg-ti/the-lab/teams-24-25/project-arcade/games.git
```

### Install Dependencies

Navigate into the project folder and install the required dependencies:

```bash
cd games
npm install
```

### Running the Application

To run the application locally, you can use the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

This will start a local development server, and you can view the games by opening your browser and going to:

```
http://localhost:8080
```

### Building the Application

To build the project for production (optimized for performance), run:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create a `dist` folder containing the production-ready files that can be deployed.
